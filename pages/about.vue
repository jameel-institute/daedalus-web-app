    <h2>The DAEDALUS Explore dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      DAEDALUS Explore is an interactive dashboard tool that allows users to
      simulate the health, education and economic impacts of hypothetical future
      pandemic scenarios for {{ numberOfPandemics }} pandemics of varying severity in {{ numberOfCountries }}
      countries. The {{ numberOfPandemics }} pandemics are informed by the characteristics of
      pathogens that have caused historic pandemics.
    </p>
    <p>The dashboard provides estimates of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="estimate in appStore.metadata?.results.time_series" :key="estimate.id">
        {{ estimate.label }}
      </li>
      <li>Economic losses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DAEDALUS Explore allows users to choose a country, a pandemic, and a
      response amongst four options (no closures, school closures, business
      closures, and elimination). Response is the mitigation that policy makers
      can choose once the pandemic strikes. DAEDALUS Explore allows users to
      explore the inherent trade-off between different response strategies. For
      example, business closures may result in higher economic costs, but lower
      deaths compared to a response that does not mandate closures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The losses associated with pandemics can be influenced by investments into
      global vaccine R&D, manufacturing and hospital capacity. Users can
      explore the impact of such investments on health, education and economic
      pandemic impacts by comparing the outcomes of scenarios with different
      investments. The impacts of all pandemic scenarios for the countries are
      projected in terms of GDP loss (absolute, and in % of pre-pandemic GDP),
      the long-term income loss caused by the interruption of education in schools,
      and in terms of lost life years, valued in monetary terms.
    </p>

    <h2>The DAEDALUS model</h2>
    <p>
      DAEDALUS Explore is generated by the integrated economic-epidemiological
      model DAEDALUS and uses publicly accessible data sources. For full details
      on the underlying DAEDALUS model visit
      <a href="https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus" target="_blank">Github</a>
      and read Haw et al (2022).<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <h2>Intended use</h2>
    <p>
      The DAEDALUS Explore dashboard tool employs historical disease and policy
      response data and is not updated in response to data generated from
      real-time disease outbreaks. The dashboard is therefore not intended to be
      used as a tool to predict the effects of real epidemic and pandemic
      events, nor is it fitted to health/economic outcome data from previous
      pandemics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, by changing the dashboard’s pandemic characteristics, DAEDALUS
      Explore illustrates the hypothetical societal value of differing pandemic
      preparedness and response activities, and in doing so, endeavours to
      supports effective future pandemic planning, preparedness and response.
